# F.A.Q.

## 1. How do you say mtos?

Just pronounce each letter: `m-t-o-s`.

## 2. What does `m-t-o-s` stand for?

It doesn't really stand for anything, but it sure is fun to say, try it aloud:
`m-t-o-s`.  Maybe it could stand for "Magnesium Tincture Offworld Serum," or
perhaps, "Media Transformation Operations Scheduler," or what about "Magnificent
Total Obfuscation Service."  It doesn't really matter what `m-t-o-s` stands
for, it can be used to build anything that holds data and shares that data
among devices.

Picture all the data you've ever generated on the internet, and notice subtle
patterns emerging from that great spreadsheet.

Oh, looky here, in '14 you stopped in that same coffee shop every Wednesday
when there was precipitation; it was a nice place to dry off for a second
between the bus stop and the entrance to the day gig; it was kinda a stop in
the middle of the week too, and aren't those nice.

Yeah, your life activities are logged and recorded on the servers of many
corporate entities (or do they have titles now?  Sir Sandoz, Dr Dupont, Prof
Purina).  Your habits are a lattice network of probabilities.  You, Smotchkiss
will probably respond favorably to this clever allusion to a bygone days,
camping trips, new shoes.  Or perhaps you'll click today's 50th ad for the
rucksack you were looking at yesterday.

That image you've constructed in your mind of the subtle patterns emerging from
your trail of datapoints is the way corporations see you.

But what if, dear Smotchkiss, what if... what if your data trail looked like a
hopeless jumble of white noise, what if the randomness of your trail was so
complete that it disallowed inspection by a third party because any service
provider hosting your data saw it as opaque chunks of impenetrable nothingness,
empty?

## 3. Why is the logo the AIGA wastebasket?

A muted bugle just wouldn't have been subtle, would it.
