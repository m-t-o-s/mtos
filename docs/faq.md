# F.A.Q.

## 1. How do you say mtos?

Just pronounce each letter: `m-t-o-s`.

## 2. What does `m-t-o-s` stand for?

It doesn't really stand for anything, but it sure is fun to say, try it aloud:
`m-t-o-s`.  Maybe it could stand for "Magnesium Tincture Offworld Serum," or
perhaps, "Media Transformation Operations Scheduler," or what about "Magnificent
Total Obfuscation Service."  It doesn't really matter what `m-t-o-s` stands
for, it can be used to build anything that holds data and shares that data
among devices.
